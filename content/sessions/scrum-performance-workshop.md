Many organizations use Scrum, Agile, Lean or Kanban software development frameworks to develop software and create products.
The gap between Scrum by the book and Scrum in the real world can be huge!
Scrum may be easy to learn, but it can be very hard to do well.

This intermediate to advanced workshop is for Scrum and Agile practitioners who want to understand Scrum more deeply and transform their teams and their companies into more Agile organizations.
How are you really doing Scrum? How is that different from Scrum by the book?

Without being judgmental, we will reflect on whether those differences are healthy, tolerable or counter-productive?
What should you change and what can leave the way it is?
Every participant will leave this workshop with new inspiration for improving their own organization, starting on Monday morning!
