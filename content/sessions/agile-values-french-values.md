"Scrum won't work here! It might work in &lt;some other place&gt;, but our values are different."
How many people have had that reaction to a new or foreign idea: This won't work here because "our situation is different"?
This interactive session will explore agile values and how to apply them in any context. 

In this interactive workshop, we will explore

* What are values and what role do they play in our lives?
* What are French values (and how are they different from the values of other countries)?
* What are Agile and Scrum Values?
* How can you apply Agile Values in your context?

An exploration of value systems, how they mix, match or conflict, and looking at how to apply Agile across cultures and beyond IT.
